## Log in the app

For logging in the app you should use `+1 555 555 5555` phone number and the `123456` pass code. 

## Set up the app for you

For implementing your own Firebase projects don't forget to import your `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS and `google-services.json` for Android. The `bundle/application ID` of the app is `com.ovidiuusvat.crew`.

If you want to configure the app for your own `Google Vision API` account, you shoud replace the file from `assets/data/credentials.json` with your configuration `json` file.
